To play the game, you first type bash, then you run the Homework script:
    % bash;source ~/PA2/PA2.sh
    Receiving room
    You are in a round, stone room with a door to the east.  There
    is a sign on the wall that reads: ‘receiving room’.
    There is a lamp nearby.
    There is a shiny brass key here.
    There is a shovel here.
    There is a slip of paper here.
    There is an axe here.
    There is an emerald bracelet here.
    >

The above looks just like it looked in the explanatoryWalkthrough.txt file
from the previous homework.

Moving on:
    >x shovel
    It is a normal shovel with a price tag attached that says $19.99.
    >e
    Northbound Hallway
    You are at the south end of a hallway that leads to the north.  There
    are rooms to the east and west.
    >e
    Sauna
    You are in a sauna.  There is nothing in the room except for a dial
    on the wall.  A door leads out to west.
    It is normal room temperature in here
    >x dial
    The dial points to a temperature scale which has long since faded away.
    >w
    Northbound Hallway
    >d
    You cannot go that way.
    >
Most of these above behaviors are just like in the original dunnet game. The
only difference is that we did not get warned about the grue when we entered
the sauna. That part of the game will not be implemented until the next
homework.

Moving on:
    >w
    Receiving room
    There is a lamp nearby.
    There is a shiny brass key here.
    There is a shovel here.
    There is a slip of paper here.
    There is an axe here.
    There is an emerald bracelet here.
    >x lamp
    The lamp is hand-crafted by Geppetto.
    >i
    You currently have:
    >
The above is also just like the original game. Notice that our inventory is
empty.

You implement the inventory by putting things in the directory ~/PA2/rooms/i/i.
The game starts with nothing in your inventory, so this directory is empty:
    >ls ~/PA2/rooms/i/i
    >echo something > ~/PA2/rooms/i/i/something
    >echo somethingelse > ~/PA2/rooms/i/i/somethingelse
    >ls ~/PA2/rooms/i/i
    >something  somethingelse
    >i
    You currently have:
    A something
    A somethingelse
    >rm ~/PA2/rooms/i/i/s*
    >ls ~/PA2/rooms/i/i
    >i
    You currently have:
    >
The above proves the "i" command is displaying what is in the ~/PA2/rooms/i/i
directory (If we put weird files in the directory, the "i" command lists them).

But how do we properly put things into our inventory? We "get" them. But our
get command will be a little different than the original game:
    >get all
    sh: get: command not found
    >getall
    Taken: a axe
    Taken: a bracelet
    Taken: a key
    Taken: a lamp
    Taken: a paper
    Taken: a shovel
    >
In the real game, we would have typed "get all", but we see that typing that
doesn't work. For now, we can only use one-word commands, so we typed "getall".
This difference arises because aliases cannot use arguments. (Please note,
this is not a problem of the alias command; it is just that we are trying to
write a game with only two weeks of UNIX lectures. You should just be impressed
that UNIX is powerful enough that we can make something work, despite not yet
knowing many commands or knowing how to create variables, loops, etc.)

But, is it really true that aliases can't use arguments? Didn't we examine the
shovel, by typing "x shovel"? Isn't "x" an alias and isn't "shovel" an argument
to the "x" alias? Well, yes, it is. We use "x" as an alias for "cat". When we
typed "x shovel", the x was replaced and it became "cat shovel". In the first
homework, we had inserted a file named shovel in the receivingRoom directory.
And the contents of that file was, in fact: "It is a normal shovel with a price
tag attached that says $19.99."

So when I say that alias cannot use arguments, I mean we can't do something 
like this:
    % alias x2='cat [arg] || echo I do not see that here.'
    % x2 shovel
    cat: '[arg]': No such file or directory
    I do not see that here. shovel
    %
See? the argument to the alias just went at the end. That means that, in this
case, it became a second argument to the echo command, meaning that we actually
had run this:
    % cat [arg] || echo I do not see that here. shovel
    cat: '[arg]': No such file or directory
    I do not see that here. shovel
    %

The problem isn't that "[arg]" is the wrong syntax; rather, the problem is
that there is no right syntax. As a consequence, our "x" command only works
on objects that are in our current room. It doesn't work on objects in our
inventory (unlike how the real game does), and it doesn't print the best error
message when it fails. Compare:
    Programming Assignment #2:            The Real Dunnet Game:

    >                                     >

From the above, we see exactly the problems just described: 1) we can't examine
the shovel or lamp when they are in our inventory, but only when they are in
the room, and 2) rather that getting the meaningful messages: "I don't see that
here." and "I don't know what that is.", we instead get the ugly message, "cat:
...: No such file or directory". (Can we do better? The answer is yes, but only
in homework #3.) For now, once again, just be amazed that we can write so much
of the game by just tricking UNIX into becoming the game, without writing an
actual program.

In the above, we also see that the messages generated for "getall" are slightly
different from those that the real game generates for "get all". The output,
though different, looks OK as it is. But it can be improved in later homeworks.

Anyway, let's restart playing our current game:
    % bash;source ~/PA2/PA2.sh
    Receiving room
    You are in a round, stone room with a door to the east.  There
    is a sign on the wall that reads: ‘receiving room’.
    There is a lamp nearby.
    There is a shiny brass key here.
    There is a shovel here.
    There is a slip of paper here.
    There is an axe here.
    There is an emerald bracelet here.
    >e
    Northbound Hallway
    You are at the south end of a hallway that leads to the north.  There
    are rooms to the east and west.
    >n
    End of N/S Hallway
    You are at the end of a north/south hallway.  You can go back to the south,
    or off to a room to the east.
    >e
    Weight room
    You are in an old weight room.  All of the equipment is either destroyed or
    completely broken.  There is a door out to the west, and there is a ladder
    leading down a hole in the floor.
    There is a 10 pound weight here.
    There is a life preserver here.
    >

Let's consider the objects in this room:
    >x weight
    You observe that the weight is heavy.
    >x ladder
    It is a normal ladder that is permanently attached to the hole.
    >x preserver
    It says S. S. Minnow.
    >x life
    cat: life: No such file or directory
    >
From the above, we see that the word "life" is not a synoym for "preserver"
(but they are synonyms in the real game). We will fix this in the next
programming assignment.

Now, let's see if the maze passage is properly closed:
    >d
    Maze button room
    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
    There is a button on the ground here.
    >nw
    You cannot go that way.
    >u
    Weight room
    There is a 10 pound weight here.
    There is a life preserver here.
    >
From the above, we see that the maze is currently working correctly. That is to
say: the button isn't pressed, and we can't move nw (but can go up the ladder).

Let's try to press the button:
    >d
    Maze button room
    >x button
    As you press the button, you notice a passageway open up, but
    as you release it, the passageway closes.
    >press button
    As you press the button, you notice a passageway open up, but
    as you release it, the passageway closes.
    >nw
    You cannot go that way.
    >
    
So it looks like "press" behaves just like "x". But this is not actually true,
as we will see if we try pressing anything other than the button:
    >press ladder
    You cannot press that.
    >x ladder
    It is a normal ladder that is permanently attached to the hole.
    >press lamp
    sh: lamp: No such file or directory
    >x lamp
    cat: lamp: No such file or directory
    >

Objects that are present are said to not be pressable, rather than displaying
their descriptions. Objects that are not present still create an ugly error
message, but it is a different ugly message than the one generated by "x".
The PA2assignment.txt file describes how to implement "press", and explains why
it acts a little differently than "x".

Anyway, let's try getting the button to be pressed by the weight:
    >drop weight
    sh: drop: command not found
    >dropweight
    You do not have that.
    >
From the above, we see that the "drop weight" command has been replaced by
"dropweight". This was done for the exact same reason as why we had to use
"getall" instead of "get all". This problem will be resolved in the next
programming assignment. Of course we could not drop it, since we don't have it.
So, let's get it:
    >u
    Weight room
    There is a 10 pound weight here.
    There is a life preserver here.
    >getall
    Taken: a preserver
    Taken: a weight
    >
From the above, we see that there is no weight limit in this homework. In the
real game, it would have said that this was too heavy. We will implemented
that in the next assignment.

Let's drop the weight:
    >dropweight
    Done.
    >d
    Maze button room
    There is a button on the ground here.
    >u
    Weight room
    There is a 10 pound weight here.
    >
From the above, we see that dropping the weight in the wrong room does not
press the button (ie, we can still go up the ladder).

So, let's drop it correctly: 
    >getall
    Taken: a weight
    >d
    Maze button room
    There is a button on the ground here.
    >dropweight
    Done.
    A passageway opens.
    >l
    Maze button room
    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
    There is a 10 pound weight here.
    There is a button on the ground here.
    >i
    You currently have:
    A preserver    
    >u
    You cannot go that way.
    >
From the above we see that the button is pressed, because we cannot go up.

Now let's pick up the weight and see what happens:
    >getall
    Taken: a weight
    >u
    You cannot go that way.
    >
From the above, we see that the button did not get unpressed. This is a problem
that we will not fix until the next programming assignment.

Now let's get through the maze:
    >nw
    Maze
    You are in a maze of little twisty passages, all alike.
    >u
    Maze 
    You are in a maze of thirsty little passages, all alike.
    There is a floppy disk here.
    There is a wax statuette of Richard Stallman here.
    >getall
    Taken: a floppy
    Taken: a rms
    >se
    Maze  
    You are in a maze of twenty little passages, all alike.
    >d
    Maze   
    You are in a daze of twisty little passages, all alike.
    >nw
    Maze    
    You are in a maze of twisty little cabbages, all alike.
    >ne
    Weight room
    >
We made it through the maze. We need to now pick up our items (but we won't use
the sauna to melt the wax statuette, until a later homework):
    >w
    End of N/S Hallway
    >s
    Northbound Hallway
    >w
    Receiving room
    There is a lamp nearby.
    There is a shiny brass key here.
    There is a shovel here.
    There is a slip of paper here.
    There is an axe here.
    There is an emerald bracelet here.
    >getall
    Taken: a axe
    Taken: a bracelet
    Taken: a key
    Taken: a lamp
    Taken: a paper
    Taken: a shovel
    >

Now let's get through the maze, to the outside:
    >e
    Northbound Hallway
    >n
    End of N/S Hallway
    >e
    Weight room
    >d
    Maze button room
    >nw
    Maze
    >u
    Maze 
    >se
    Maze  
    >d
    Maze   
    >nw
    Maze    
    >nw
    Reception area
    You are in a reception area for a health and fitness center.  The place
    appears to have been recently ransacked, and nothing is left.  There is
    a door out to the south, and a crawlspace to the southeast.
    >
At this point we are ready to go outside. In the real game, this could kill you
by fire or water. But death will only be added in programming assignment #3.

So we can proceed without fear:
    >s
    Health Club front
    You are outside a large building to the north which used to be a health
    and fitness center.  A road leads to the south.
    >s
    Lakefront North
    You are at the north side of a lake.  On the other side you can see
    a road which leads to a cave.  The water appears very deep.
    >x lake
    I see nothing special about that.
    >s
    Lakefront South
    You are at the south side of a lake.  A road goes to the south.
    >s
    Cave Entrance
    The entrance to a cave is to the south.  To the north, a road leads
    towards a deep lake.  On the ground nearby there is a chute, with a sign
    that says ‘put treasures here for points’.
    >x chute
    I see nothing special about that.
    >

At this point, it is time to keep score. We currently have one treasure, the
bracelet. In the real game, we have to type "put bracelet in chute". But to
implement this, we would need our alias to accept arguments. So this will not
be implemented until programming assignment #3.

For now, we will just implement "put" with no arguments. It's meaning is as
follows: 1) if you are in a room that has a way to store treasure (ie, the
chute or the urinal), and 2) if you have a treasure (ie, the bracelet and/or
the gold), then move those treasure(s) from you inventory to somewhere we'll
describe in a moment. So let's see if "put" behaves as we expect:
    >n
    Lakefront South
    >put
    Nothing to put treasures into.
    >score
    You have scored 00 points.
    >i
    You currently have:
    A axe
    A bracelet
    A floppy
    A key
    A lamp
    A paper
    A preserver
    A rms
    A shovel
    >s
    Cave Entrance
    >put
    You hear it slide down the chute and off into the distance.
    You have scored 10 points.
    >
Yes, the above did behave as expected. We start out with a score of 0 (although
we use two digits, 00), and you must be next to the chute to put the bracelet
into it.

So we would expect that, now that we don't have the bracelet, we won't be able
to put anything into the chute (in the actual game, other things can go into
the chute, but they give no points). Let's see if the game gets this right:
    >put
    No treasure to put into it.
    >n
    Lakefront South
    >put
    Nothing to put treasures into.
    >i
    You currently have:
    A axe
    A floppy
    A key
    A lamp
    A paper
    A preserver
    A rms
    A shovel
    >score
    You have scored 10 points.
    >

So that all works. But where did the bracelet go? Well, let's see:
    >ls ~/PA2/rooms
    buttonRoom  i  mistyRoom  receivingRoom  There  treasureRoom
    >cd ~/PA2/rooms/treasureRoom/
    >ls
    9  bracelet  description
    >l
    Treasure room
    You are in the treasure room.  A door leads out to the north.
    There is an emerald bracelet here.
    >n
    You cannot go that way.
    >
There is actually a treasure room. (This is literally true: if you were to play
all of the levels of the game, you would end up in this room.) I used "cd" to
cheat and enter the treasure room without completing the game. When I tried to
go north, however, it did not work. That is because we are not implementing
this part of the game. (We are implementing the treasure room itself, however,
because this is used to calculate the score.)

So let's move on:
    >s
    Cave Entrance
    >s
    Misty Room
    You are in a misty, humid room carved into a mountain.
    To the north is the remains of a rockslide.  To the east, a small
    passage leads away into the darkness.
    There is a gold bar here.
    >n
    You cannot go that way.
    >basename `pwd`
    mistyRoom
    >

We can't go back. We are now in ~/PA2/rooms/mistyRoom. Let's get more treasure:
    >getall
    Taken: a gold
    >e
    Cave E/W passage
    You are in an east/west passageway.  The walls here are made of
    multicolored rock and are quite beautiful.
    >e
    N/S/W Junction
    You are at the junction of two passages. One goes north/south, and
    the other goes west.
    >s
    South end of cave passage
    You are at the south end of a north/south passageway.  There is a hole
    in the floor here, into which you could probably fit.
    >d
    Bathroom
    You are in a bathroom built for workers in the cave.  There is a
    urinal hanging on the wall, and some exposed pipes on the opposite
    wall where a sink used to be.  To the north is a bedroom.
    >i
    You currently have:
    A axe
    A floppy
    A gold
    A key
    A lamp
    A paper
    A preserver
    A rms
    A shovel
    >

Now we are in the place where we can store the treasure, and we have the gold.
So let's try to put it in the urinal:
    >score
    You have scored 10 points.
    >put
    You hear it plop down in some water below.
    >score
    You have scored 10 points.
    >
Hey! Why didn't I get any points for the gold?

I did drop it, didn't I? Let's check:
    >i
    You currently have:
    A axe
    A floppy
    A key
    A lamp
    A paper
    A preserver
    A rms
    A shovel
    >
Yes, I don't have it anymore. But if it was in the treasure room I'd have my
points wouldn't I?:
    >ls ~/PA2/rooms/treasureRoom/
    9  bracelet  description
    >
Correct. If it were in the treasure room, I would get my points. But it isn't
there.

Where is it? I've put it in the urinal here, so maybe it's still in the room?:
    >l
    Bathroom
    You are in a bathroom built for workers in the cave.  There is a
    urinal hanging on the wall, and some exposed pipes on the opposite
    wall where a sink used to be.  To the north is a bedroom.
    >getall
    Nothing to take.
    >
No, the gold is not here either. It is simply gone.

Well, let's think about this. The game said, "You hear it plop down in some 
water below." That is why I cannot get it back. The next step in the game is
to flush it out of the pipe:
    >ls ~/PA2/rooms/treasureRoom/
    9  bracelet  description
    >score
    You have scored 10 points.
    >flush
    Whoooosh!!
    You have scored 20 points.
    >ls ~/PA2/rooms/treasureRoom/
    9  bracelet  description  gold
    >

There is another point to make about the treasures. The game lets other items
get put into the treasure room. Although our put command will not allow this
(until the next homework), we can still make it happen, by simply putting those
items directly into the treasure room from our inventory:
    >mv ~/PA2/rooms/i/i/* ~/PA2/rooms/treasureRoom/
    >ls ~/PA2/rooms/treasureRoom/
    9    bracelet     floppy  key   paper      rms
    axe  description  gold    lamp  preserver  shovel
    >i
    >score
    You have scored 20 points.
    >
From the above, we see that the score command knows that only the gold and the
bracelet are worth points. (Each treasure in the game is worth 10 points.)

Let's take all of the items back out of the treasure room:
    >mv ~/PA2/rooms/treasureRoom/[^9d]* ~/PA2/rooms/i/i
    >ls ~/PA2/rooms/treasureRoom/
    9  description
    >i
    You currently have:
    A axe
    A bracelet
    A floppy
    A gold
    A key
    A lamp
    A paper
    A preserver
    A rms
    A shovel
    >score
    You have scored 00 points.
    >

Now let's use "put" again. This time we have two treasures. They both will
go into the urinal. But there will only be one message, the same as before.
    > ls ~/PA2/rooms/i/i
    axe       floppy  key   paper      rms
    bracelet  gold    lamp  preserver  shovel
    >put
    You hear it plop down in some water below.
    > ls ~/PA2/rooms/i/i
    axe  floppy  key  lamp  paper  preserver  rms  shovel    
    > ls ~/PA2/rooms/treasureRoom
    9  description
    > ls
    9  description  pipe  pipes  urinal
    >

So both treasures were move. But where are they? They are in ~/PA2/rooms:
   >ls ~/PA2/rooms
   bracelet  buttonRoom  gold  i  mistyRoom  receivingRoom  There  treasureRoom
   >

So what the flush command does is: it moves treasures -- and only treasures --
from the ~/PA2/rooms directory to the treasure room:
   >flush
   Whoooosh!!
   You have scored 20 points.
   >ls ~/PA2/rooms/treasureRoom/
   9  bracelet  description  gold
   >ls ~/PA2/rooms
   buttonRoom  i  mistyRoom  receivingRoom  There  treasureRoom
   >

So now we understand the scoring system. But looking at the above ~/PA2/rooms
directory, we notice a file called "There". What is that for? Well, let's see:
   >cat ~/PA2/rooms/There
   There is a 10 pound weight here.
   There is a beach towel on the ground here.
   There is a box with a slit in it, bolted to the wall here.
   There is a button on the ground here.
   There is a floppy disk here.
   There is a gold bar here.
   There is a hole in the floor here.
   There is a lamp nearby.
   There is a life preserver here.
   There is a platinum bar here.
   There is a shimmering diamond here.
   There is a shiny brass key here.
   There is a shovel here.
   There is a silver bar here.
   There is a slip of paper here.
   There is an axe here.
   There is an emerald bracelet here.
   There is a wax statuette of Richard Stallman here.;rms
   It is normal room temperature in here.;temperature2
   It is luke warm in here.;temperature3
   It is comfortably hot in here.;temperature4
   It is refreshingly hot in here.;temperature5
   >

So we see that it lists messages for all of our objects. Here they are:
   >fgrep -eaxe -ebracelet -efloppy -egold -ekey -elamp -epaper -epreserver -erms -eshovel -eweight ~/PA2/rooms/There 
   There is a 10 pound weight here.
   There is a floppy disk here.
   There is a gold bar here.
   There is a lamp nearby.
   There is a life preserver here.
   There is a shiny brass key here.
   There is a shovel here.
   There is a slip of paper here.
   There is an axe here.
   There is an emerald bracelet here.
   There is a wax statuette of Richard Stallman here.;rms
   >
The above are, in fact, the messages that display when we enter the rooms
containing these objects.

But wait. There were other objects in the list, besides the ones we've seen.
What are those? Well here they are:
   >fgrep -v -eaxe -ebracelet -efloppy -egold -ekey -elamp -epaper -epreserver -erms -eshovel -eweight ~/PA2/rooms/There
   There is a beach towel on the ground here.
   There is a box with a slit in it, bolted to the wall here.
   There is a button on the ground here.
   There is a hole in the floor here.
   There is a platinum bar here.
   There is a shimmering diamond here.
   There is a silver bar here.
   It is normal room temperature in here.;temperature2
   It is luke warm in here.;temperature3
   It is comfortably hot in here.;temperature4
   It is refreshingly hot in here.;temperature5
   >
   
A few of the above look familiar:
   >fgrep -ebutton -ediamond -etemperatue ~/PA2/rooms/There
   There is a button on the ground here.
   There is a shimmering diamond here.
   It is normal room temperature in here.;temperature2
   It is luke warm in here.;temperature3
   It is comfortably hot in here.;temperature4
   It is refreshingly hot in here.;temperature5
   >

In our explanatory walkthrough from homework 1, we saw the above messages at
various points: The diamond is obtained by melting the statuette (but not until
the next homework). The messages about the temperature are seen when you enter
the sauna, based on the dial's setting (but we won't change the dial until the
next homework). And the button is in the maze room. Every time you enter that
room, it tells you about the button -- and yet, it isn't an object that you can
pick up. Of course there are other objects that you cannot pick up: the maze
buttonRoom has a ladder, for example, and the bathroom that we are currently
in has pipes and a urinal:
    >l
    Bathroom
    You are in a bathroom built for workers in the cave.  There is a
    urinal hanging on the wall, and some exposed pipes on the opposite
    wall where a sink used to be.  To the north is a bedroom.
    >ls
    9  description  pipe  pipes  urinal
    >getall
    Nothing to take.
    >
The button is different than these other objects that you cannot get, however,
because the button does display a message each time you enter the room. That is
why it gets a line in the There file.

But there were some other objects in "There". What are they?:
   >fgrep -v -eaxe -ebracelet -efloppy -egold -ekey -elamp -epaper -epreserver -erms -eshovel -eweight -ebutton -ediamond -etemperatue ~/PA2/rooms/There
   There is a beach towel on the ground here.
   There is a box with a slit in it, bolted to the wall here.
   There is a hole in the floor here.
   There is a platinum bar here.
   There is a silver bar here.
   >

Where are these objects? They are found within a part of the game that we will
be implementing in later homeworks. If you want to know, they are located near
our current location in the bathroom. See here:
    >n
    Bedroom
    You are in what appears to be a worker's bedroom.  There is a queen-
    sized bed in the middle of the room, and a painting hanging on the
    wall.  A door leads to another room to the south, and stairways
    lead up and down.
    >d
    You cannot go that way.
    >
    
You see? The bedroom's message says that we can go down, but the game won't
let us. This is because we haven't built these rooms yet. But we do need to
be aware of the objects that will be down there, because we need our commands
to work with them, once we add them in later homeworks. The PA2assignment.txt
file describes how to use the provided filenamesdir directory to test if your
wildcard patterns find all of the intended matches and no unintended ones.

Let's continue on, by taking a look at this bedroom that we are now in:
    >ls
    9  bed  description  painting  s
    >x bed
    It is a queen sized bed, with a very firm mattress.
    >x painting
    It is a velvet painting of Elvis Presley.  It seems to be nailed to the
    wall, and you cannot move it.
    >getall
    Nothing to take.
    >s
    Bathroom
    >u
    You cannot go that way.
    >ls
    9  description  pipe  pipes  urinal
    >cd ..
    >l
    Bedroom
    You are in what appears to be a worker's bedroom.  There is a queen-
    sized bed in the middle of the room, and a painting hanging on the
    wall.  A door leads to another room to the south, and stairways
    lead up and down.
    >

You will recall that we entered the bathroom by going down a hole that we
cannot climb back up. The cd .. always takes us to the bedroom:
    >u
    North end of cave passage
    You are at the north end of a north/south passageway.  There are stairs
    leading down from here.  There is also a door leading west.
    >s
    N/S/W Junction
    >s
    South end of cave passage
    >l
    South end of cave passage
    You are at the south end of a north/south passageway.  There is a hole
    in the floor here, into which you could probably fit.
    >ls -l
    total 2
    -rw-r--r-- 1 Me None   0 Jan 25 01:17 1

    >cd ..

    Bedroom
    You are in what appears to be a worker's bedroom.  There is a queen-

    wall.  A door leads to another room to the south, and stairways
    lead up and down.
    >
    
OK. So now there is only one place left to talk about, the locked room:
    >u
    North end of cave passage
    >l
    North end of cave passage
    You are at the north end of a north/south passageway.  There are stairs
    leading down from here.  There is also a door leading west.
    >w
    You cannot go that way.
    >ls -l
    total 1
    -rw-r--r--  1 Me None   0 Jan 25 01:18 9
    drwxr-xr-x+ 1 Me None   0 Jan 25 21:53 d
    -rw-r--r--  1 Me None 158 Jan 24 22:03 description
    dr--r--r--+ 1 Me None   0 Jan 24 22:08 w
    >cd w
    -bash: cd: w: Permission denied
    >

In the above, we are told, "You cannot go that way." This is not how the real
game plays. This room has a combination lock, and you will be asked for the
combination. This will be implemented in the next homework. For now, we just
get the message that we cannot go that way. This is because we do not have the
right permissions. But we do have read permission, however, so we can look into
the room:
    >ls w
    9  cable  description  ibm
    >cat w/description
    Gamma computing center
    You are in the Gamma Computing Center.  An IBM 3090/600s is whirring
    away in here.  There is an ethernet cable coming out of one of the units,
    and going through the ceiling.  There is no console here on which you
    could type.
    >cat w/cable
    I see nothing special about that.
    >cat w/ibm
    I see nothing special about that.
    >quit
    You have scored 20 points.
    %

So now we have seen a rather thorough example of how your homework should
behave. But before moving on to implementation (in the PA2assignment.txt file),
let's consider a simpler walkthrough, considering just the set of inputs tested
in the basic grading requirement, as provided in the testInput.sh file:
    % head -5 testInput.sh
    source ~/PA2/PA2.sh
    echo ">x lamp";x lamp
    echo ">x shovel";x shovel
    echo ">e";e
    echo ">n";n
    %
    
From the above, we see that this file begins by running your homework solution
file, to start the game. It then performs a series of game commands. But it
echoes each command before executing it. Why does it do this? The reason is
because this input file is meant to be used by the checkYourOutput.sh script:

    % cat checkYourOutput.sh
    echo "Be patient. This might take up to 2 minutes to run..."
    (source ~/PA2/testInput.sh)>~/PA2/testOutput.txt
    echo Finished Running. Now checking for differences to the expected output:
    cd ~/PA2
    diff testOutput.txt expectedOutput.txt && echo You passed the basic test.
    %

See how the above script runs testInput.txt? By echoing the commands before
running them, the testOutput.txt file will show the commands that are causing
the outputs. Notice also that the above script compares your output to the
expectedOutput.txt file. So this file is the walkthrough for the basic test:
    % head -21 expectedOutput.txt
    Receiving room
    You are in a round, stone room with a door to the east.  There
    is a sign on the wall that reads: ‘receiving room’.
    There is a lamp nearby.
    There is a shiny brass key here.
    There is a shovel here.
    There is a slip of paper here.
    There is an axe here.
    There is an emerald bracelet here.
    >x lamp
    The lamp is hand-crafted by Geppetto.
    >x shovel
    It is a normal shovel with a price tag attached that says $19.99.
    >e
    Northbound Hallway
    You are at the south end of a hallway that leads to the north.  There
    are rooms to the east and west.
    >n
    End of N/S Hallway
    You are at the end of a north/south hallway.  You can go back to the south,
    or off to a room to the east.

Indeed, the above 21 lines are the expected output for the first 4 commands
from testInput.sh ("x lamp","x shovel","e","n"). If we look further into the
test input, we see something interesting:
    % head -13 testInput.sh | cat -n
         1  source ~/PA2/PA2.sh
         2  echo ">x lamp";x lamp
         3  echo ">x shovel";x shovel
         4  echo ">e";e
         5  echo ">n";n
         6  echo ">e";e
         7  echo ">i";i
         8  echo ">getall";getall
         9  echo ">i";i
        10  echo ">d";d
        11  echo ">cd ../../../../../buttonRoom";cd ../../../../../buttonRoom
        12  echo ">l";l
        13  echo ">nw";nw
    %
    
The interesting thing to see above is that I used the cd command to go to the
buttonRoom directory (on line 11). This is a hack. What I really should have
done is to execute "dropweight" (since I picked the weight up on line 8). But
I've used cd instead, because the basic test that you need to pass to not get
a 0% will not test dropweight.

Q1: Why does it not test "dropweight", but does test "getall"?
A1: Because I randomly chose a subset of things I require in the basic test.

Q2: Does that mean that I don't need to implement dropweight?
A2: Somewhat. If you just want a (failing) 50% grade, then you don't need to
    implement dropweight. But, even if you want to get a good grade, you should
    not start by doing dropweight.

Q3: What do you mean "not start by doing dropweight"?
A3: Well, if you implement the things required by the test input, then you get
    at least a 50% score. One of those things is getall. So, an implementation
    solution without a getall command earns a 0%, even if you've implemented
    advance features like dropweight. Therefore, you should implement the basic
    things first. Make sure that you pass the checkYourOutput.sh script before
    moving on. AND SAVE A BACKUP OF THAT SOLUTION, just in case you mistakenly
    break one of those commands while trying to do the more complex parts.

Q4: What are the basic parts and what are the advanced parts?
A4: - Look in the testInput.sh file and see which commands are not used by it.
    - Also notice that the tested movement always involves going forward, never
      backward.  This means that the commands for "e", "n", "s", etc, can be
      implemented very simply and do not need to have the complexity of the
      "basename ..." part. (Q4a: The "basename ... part"? A4a: When you read
      PA2assignment.txt, you will see that you are meant to use basename and
      some other things to accomplish backtracking. But if there is no back-
      tracking, then you don't have to implement it to achieve basic movement.)
    - Also, since there is no backtracking, you never re-enter a room. So the
      full description can be displayed each time, without using the "head ..."
      part to implement the short display for re-visited rooms. (Q4b: The "head
      ... part"? A4b: When you read PA2assignment.txt, you will see that the
      "disp" command uses head to achieve short descriptions.)
    - Also notice that the test input never takes a wrong turn in the maze.
    - Also notice that the test input never makes any mistakes that would cause
      an error message to display: 
          % cat expectedOutput.txt | fgrep -w -eNo  -enot -ecannot -eNothing
          %
      This means that your first implementations of the various commands don't
      need to handle errors. You don't try moving somewhere you can't. You
      don't try getting something you can't, putting something you can't, or
      examining something you can't.

Q5: What do I do after the basic parts work?
A5: Add in the other features, one-at-a time. Follow this process:
    1. Save a backup.
    2. Implement one new feature. Start by trying it out on the command line.
    3. Add the feature into your answer script.
    4. Replay the game with your new script and test the new feature.
    5. Rerun the checkYourOutput.sh script to make sure you didn't break it.


Now that you've finished reading this file, next read PA2shortAssignment.txt,
