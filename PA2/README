                           Programming Assignment #2
                       Due: Monday, March 29, at 11:59pm

In the first programming assignment, we learned about the dunnet game, and we
created the rooms and objects for this game. We also saw a walkthrough of the
game, but we did not implement the game play.

In this new programming assignment, we will take a first step to programming
the game. We will combine the rooms and objects from the first homework with
a set of aliases to implement some of the dunnet game's commands.

Some commands will be implemented to behave much like in the real game: score,
flush, press, i, x (for examining objects), l (for looking at the room), and
moving (e,w,n,s,u,d,ne,nw,se,sw). (In the actual game, x and l are synonyms,
but we will separate them for now: x will take an argument and l will not.)

Other commands will be implemented in a limited way, to simplify the difficulty
of the homework, and to avoid passing arguments to them: getall (behaves like
"get all"), dropweight (behaves like "drop weight"), and put (behaves like "put
bracelet/gold in chute/urinal").

Let's now see what files have been provided. If you are reading this current
README file, then you must have untarred Programming Assignment #2's tar file.
Looking in that directory, you will see:
    % ls ~/PA2
    PA2assignment.txt       expectedOutput.txt  savedgame
    PA2shortAssignment.txt  filenamesdir        testInput.sh
    README                  gradingPolicy.txt   walkthroughPA2.txt
    checkYourOutput.sh      rooms.tar
    %

Five of these above files should be read in the following order: README,
walkthroughPA2.txt, PA2shortAssignment.txt, PA2assignment.txt, and
gradingPolicy.txt. These files describe the requirements of the assignment.
(The PA2shortAssignment.txt file is a simplified implementation of the full
version described in PA2assignment.txt. Implementing this version first will
ensure that you will get at least a 50%)

Three more of these files are for testing: testInput.sh, expectedOutput.txt,
and checkYourOutput.sh. These files are described the walkthrough.txt file.

The savedgame file is the same file that you had for programming assignment #1.

The rooms.tar file is my solution to the first homework, but with some added
files and directories. You can expand it, and see what is in it. You'll see
that it has two extra directories named "treasureRoom" and "i", and two extra
files, named "There" and "es". The reason for these additional directories and
files will be explained in the walkthroughPA2.txt and PA2assignment.txt files.
As for the directory "i", it has subdirectories "i" and "_". The subdirectory
"i/i" will be used for your inventory. The "i/_" subdirectory will be used by
by the "getall" command, as explained in the PA1assignment.txt file.

The remaining item, filenamesdir, is a directory:
    % ls ~/PA2
    PA2assignment.txt   expectedOutput.txt  rooms.tar     walkthroughPA2.txt
    README              filenamesdir        savedgame
    checkYourOutput.sh  gradingPolicy.txt   testInput.sh
    % ls ~/PA2/filenamesdir
    1         button      e       lake     pc        se            temperature5
    9         cable       floor   lamp     pipe      shovel        temperature6
    axe       chute       floppy  n        pipes     silver        towel
    bed       d           gold    ne       platinum  sw            u
    boulder   description ibm     nw       preserver temperature2  urinal
    box       dial        key     painting rms       temperature3  w
    bracelet  diamond     ladder  paper    s         temperature4  weight
    %
As we see above, this directory lists all non-hidden file/directory names used
in the game. Some of these names will look familiar to you from homework #1,
but others will not look familiar. The reason for these unfamiliar filenames is
discussed in walkthroughPA2.txt. The reason that I am giving you this directory
at all is because it is useful for testing your wildcard patterns, as explained
in the PA2assignment.txt file.

Now that you are done reading this README file, next read walkthroughPA2.txt.
It demonstrates how this homework will behave, with explanations at each step.
Then read the PA2assignment.txt file. It explains how you will make aliases to
implement the game.
Then read gradingPolicy.txt. It explains how to know that you can get a grade.
