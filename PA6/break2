You step back from the console.

Computer room
You are in a computer room.  It seems like most of the equipment has
been removed.  There is a VAX 11/780 in front of you, however, with
one of the cabinets wide open.  A sign on the front of the machine
says: This VAX is named ‘pokey’.  To type on the console, use the
‘type’ command.  The exit is to the east.
The panel lights are flashing in a seemingly organized pattern.
