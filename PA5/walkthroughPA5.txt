As you will remember, we have been implementing the second level of the game,
by loading the savedgame file that I provided to you. If you had played through
first level, however, you would have been surprised to learn how we had gotten
to this second level.

Let's now simply play through level 1, without preloading into level 2, from a
saved game file. (You won't implement level 1; we just want to understand about
it.) In order to get through level 1 as fast as possible, I'll play perfectly,
such as already knowing the passwords to the computers in the game. Let's go:
    % emacs -batch -l dunnet

    Dead end
    You are at a dead end of a dirt road.  The road goes to the east.
    In the distance you can see that it will eventually fork off.  The
    trees here are very tall royal palms, and they are spaced equidistant
    from each other.
    There is a shovel here.
    >get all
    A shovel: Taken.
    >e
    E/W Dirt road
    You are on the continuation of a dirt road.  There are more trees on
    both sides of you.  The road continues to the east and west.
    There is a large boulder here.
    >e
    Fork
    You are at a fork of two passages, one to the northeast, and one to the
    southeast.  The ground here seems very soft. You can also go back west.
    >dig
    I think you found something.
    >get all
    A computer board: Taken.
    >se
    SE/NW road
    You are on a southeast/northwest road.
    There is some food here.
    >get all
    Some food: Taken.
    >se
    Bear hangout
    You are standing at the end of a road.  A passage leads back to the
    northwest.
    There is a ferocious bear here!
    >drop food
    Done.
    The bear takes the food and runs away with it. He left something behind.
    >get all
    A brass key: Taken.
    >nw
    SE/NW road
    >nw
    Fork
    >ne
    NE/SW road
    You are on a northeast/southwest road.
    >ne
    Building front
    You are at the end of the road.  There is a building in front of you
    to the northeast, and the road leads back to the southwest.
    >ne
    Old Building hallway
    You are in the hallway of an old building.  There are rooms to the east
    and west, and doors leading out to the north and south.
    >w
    Computer room
    You are in a computer room.  It seems like most of the equipment has
    been removed.  There is a VAX 11/780 in front of you, however, with
    one of the cabinets wide open.  A sign on the front of the machine
    says: This VAX is named ‘pokey’.  To type on the console, use the
    ‘type’ command.  The exit is to the east.
    The panel lights are steady and motionless.
    >put card in vax
    As you put the CPU board in the computer, it immediately springs to life.
    The lights start flashing, and the fans seem to startup.
    >

OK. So now we have activated the computer named "pokey". I magically know its
password, so let's log in:
    >type


    UNIX System V, Release 2.2 (pokey)

    login: toukmond
    password: robert

    Welcome to Unix

    Please clean up your directories.  The filesystem is getting full.
    Our tcp/ip link to gamma is a little flaky, but seems to work.
    The current version of ftp can only send files from your home
    directory, and deletes them after they are sent!  Be careful.

    Note: Restricted bourne shell in use.

    $

The login message says that there is another computer on the network, called
gamma. That will become important in a moment. The prompt has changed to "$".
The dunnet game is about to get weird. At this point, it starts pretending to
be UNIX. (It is a pleasing symmetry to how we have been using UNIX to pretend
to be the game!)

Let's see what is in our home directory:
    $ ls
    total 467
    drwxr-xr-x  3 toukmond restricted      512 Jan 1 1970 .
    drwxr-xr-x  3 root     staff          2048 Jan 1 1970 ..
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted    10423 Jan 1 1970 ls
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted    10423 Jan 1 1970 ftp
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted    10423 Jan 1 1970 echo
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted    10423 Jan 1 1970 cd
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted    10423 Jan 1 1970 pwd
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted    10423 Jan 1 1970 rlogin
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted    10423 Jan 1 1970 ssh
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted    10423 Jan 1 1970 uncompress
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted    10423 Jan 1 1970 cat
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted        0 Jan 1 1970 paper.o.Z
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted        0 Jan 1 1970 lamp.o
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted        0 Jan 1 1970 shovel.o
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted        0 Jan 1 1970 key.o
    $

In the above, note that there are some executable files, such as ls (which we
have just used), and such as ftp and rlogin (which we'll be using in a moment).
Notice also the object files: "lamp.o", "key.o", and "shovel.o". These names
are meaningful, because the "objects" in our inventory are, in fact, the lamp,
the key, and the shovel. The next thing to try doing is to send some of these
object files to gamma:
    $ ftp gamma
    Connected to gamma. FTP ver 0.9 00:00:00 01/01/70
    Username: anonymous
    Guest login okay, send your user ident as password.
    Password: toukmond
    Guest login okay, user access restrictions apply.
    ftp> bin -i
    Type set to binary.
    ftp> send lamp.o
    Sending binary file for a lamp, (0 bytes)
    Transfer complete.
    ftp> send shovel.o
    Sending binary file for a shovel, (0 bytes)
    Transfer complete.
    ftp> quit
    $

I've sent over the lamp.o and shovel.o object files, but not the key.o file.
Let's see if the key.o file is still in our home directory:
    $ ls
    total 467
    drwxr-xr-x  3 toukmond restricted      512 Jan 1 1970 .
    drwxr-xr-x  3 root     staff          2048 Jan 1 1970 ..
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted    10423 Jan 1 1970 ls
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted    10423 Jan 1 1970 ftp
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted    10423 Jan 1 1970 echo
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted    10423 Jan 1 1970 exit
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted    10423 Jan 1 1970 cd
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted    10423 Jan 1 1970 pwd
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted    10423 Jan 1 1970 rlogin
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted    10423 Jan 1 1970 ssh
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted    10423 Jan 1 1970 uncompress
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted    10423 Jan 1 1970 cat
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted        0 Jan 1 1970 paper.o.Z
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted        0 Jan 1 1970 key.o
    $

Yes, the key.o file is still here, but the other two .o files were sent over
to gamma. Let's log-in to gamma and see them in that home directory (I happen
to know that the password is "worms"):
    $ rlogin gamma
    Password: worms

    You begin to feel strange for a moment, and you lose your items.
    You step back from the console.

    Receiving room
    You are in a round, stone room with a door to the east.  There
    is a sign on the wall that reads: ‘receiving room’.
    There is a lamp nearby.
    There is a shovel here.
    >i
    You currently have:
    >

Weird. We didn't log-in to gamma as we expected. Instead, we teleported to
level 2. (Or, did we? Are we actually typing UNIX commands in the game, just
like in our version of it? Maybe we are logged into gamma?) Anyway, we see
that the lamp and the shovel are here, and that the key is not (because we
did not ftp it over). Nor is it in our inventory.

So that is the weird story of what level 2 of the game really is.


Let's now get back to our implementation. I've provided a new saved game file,
AtGammaCenter, that has played the game a little farther. In this playthrough,
I did not go into the sauna room to get the diamond. I also came right to the
gamma center once I entered the cave. Let's see:
    >restore AtGammaCenter
    Done.
    North end of cave passage
    >l
    North end of cave passage
    You are at the north end of a north/south passageway.  There are stairs
    leading down from here.  There is also a door leading west.
    >w
    You must type a 3 digit combination code to enter this room.
    Enter it here:
    Sorry, that combination is incorrect.
    >

Yes, we are outside of the gamma computing center. But we won't go in that
room right now. We will look around more first. Now, in this saved file, I
came right to this room after entering the cave. So the room to the south
has been visited, but the room below us has not been:
    >l
    North end of cave passage
    You are at the north end of a north/south passageway.  There are stairs
    leading down from here.  There is also a door leading west.
    >s
    N/S/W Junction
    >n
    North end of cave passage
    >d
    Bedroom
    You are in what appears to be a worker's bedroom.  There is a queen-
    sized bed in the middle of the room, and a painting hanging on the
    wall.  A door leads to another room to the south, and stairways
    lead up and down.
    >

Yes, the N/S/W Junction displays a short message, but the bedroom displays a
long one, meaning that it has not been visited before.

Well, that's enough walking around. Let's get into the gamma computing center:
    >u
    North end of cave passage
    >w
    You must type a 3 digit combination code to enter this room.
    Enter it here: 418
    Gamma computing center
    You are in the Gamma Computing Center.  An IBM 3090/600s is whirring
    away in here.  There is an ethernet cable coming out of one of the units,
    and going through the ceiling.  There is no console here on which you
    could type.
    >

Our goal in the computing center is to cut the cable:
    >i
    You currently have:
    A lamp
    A shovel
    A brass key
    A bracelet
    A slip of paper
    An axe
    A life preserver
    An RMS statuette
    A floppy disk
    >drop key
    Done.
    >drop paper
    Done.
    >cut cable
    As you break the ethernet cable, everything starts to blur.  You collapse
    for a moment, then straighten yourself up.

    Connection closed.
    $

Now why did it say "Connection closed."? Oh, it is because we had entered this
level by logging into gamma. So if we've cut the cable, we cannot be logged in
anymore. Does that mean that we are back on the first computer? I guess so:
    $ ls
    total 467
    drwxr-xr-x  3 toukmond restricted      512 Jan 1 1970 .
    drwxr-xr-x  3 root     staff          2048 Jan 1 1970 ..
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted    10423 Jan 1 1970 ls
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted    10423 Jan 1 1970 ftp
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted    10423 Jan 1 1970 echo
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted    10423 Jan 1 1970 exit
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted    10423 Jan 1 1970 cd
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted    10423 Jan 1 1970 pwd
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted    10423 Jan 1 1970 rlogin

    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted    10423 Jan 1 1970 uncompress
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted    10423 Jan 1 1970 cat
    $ pwd
    /usr/toukmond
    $

Yes, we are back in our home directory on 'pokey'. Now that we understand
how this all works, let's look around on this computer:
    $ cd ..
    $ ls
    total 4
    drwxr-xr-x  3 root     staff           512 Jan 1 1970 .

    drwxr-xr-x  3 toukmond restricted      512 Jan 1 1970 toukmond
    $ cd ..
    $ ls
    total 4
    drwxr-xr-x  3 root     staff           512 Jan 1 1970 .
    drwxr-xr-x  3 root     staff          2048 Jan 1 1970 ..
    drwxr-xr-x  3 root     staff          2048 Jan 1 1970 usr
    drwxr-xr-x  3 root     staff          2048 Jan 1 1970 rooms
    $

I wonder what is in that "rooms" directory?
    $ cd rooms
    $ ls
    total 16
    drwxr-xr-x  3 root     staff           512 Jan 1 1970 .

    drwxr-xr-x  3 root     staff           512 Jan 1 1970 receiving-room
    $

Interesting. It is a list of every room that we have visited. Notice that the
bottom in the list is the receiving-room, which is the first room we visited.
And the gamma-computing-center is at the top of the list, which is the last
room we visited. The bedroom is second-to-the-top, because we visited it just
before going into the gamma computing center. Most importantly, rooms like the
bathroom or the sauna, which we never visited, do NOT display.

(Also not displayed are the rooms from the first level. This is a difference
from a straight playthrough of the game, because level 1's rooms also ought to
display -- after all, you can't get into level 2 without first playing level 1.
So why aren't they displaying in our current walkthrough? It is because I have
hacked the saved game files that I have given you, by marking those rooms as
having not been visited. I did this to make our game play more logically: since
our game doesn't implement level 1, it makes sense to not show rooms which you
haven't visited.)

OK. So let's see what is in these rooms:
    $ cd misty-room
    $ ls
    total 4
    drwxr-xr-x  3 root     staff           512 Jan 1 1970 .
    drwxr-xr-x  3 root     staff          2048 Jan 1 1970 ..
    -rwxr-xr-x  3 root     staff          2048 Jan 1 1970 description
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted        0 Jan 1 1970 gold.o
    $ cat description
    You are in a misty, humid room carved into a mountain.
    To the north is the remains of a rockslide.  To the east, a small
    passage leads away into the darkness.
    $ cat gold.o
    Ascii files only.
    $

Now that is interesting. The directory contents of these rooms looks a lot like
the contents of our directories for the rooms. There is a description file that
is just like our description files. The objects in those rooms also appear in
their directories, just like in our version (I never picked up the gold bar,
which is why it is still in the misty room). But there are three differences.
First, the object names include a ".o". Second, attempts to display the files
gives the answer "Ascii files only.". And third, only gettable objects display.

One room that is particularly interesting to look at is the gamma computing
center. When we had cut the cable, we had had many objects in our inventory.
But we have seen, above, that those objects are not in our home directory (and,
thus, not in our present inventory). Where did they go? Well, the best place to
look for something is where you last saw it. So we should got to the gamma
computing center:
    $ cd /rooms/gamma-computing-center
    $ ls
    total 4
    drwxr-xr-x  3 root     staff           512 Jan 1 1970 .
    drwxr-xr-x  3 root     staff          2048 Jan 1 1970 ..
    -rwxr-xr-x  3 root     staff          2048 Jan 1 1970 description
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted        0 Jan 1 1970 key.o
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted        0 Jan 1 1970 lamp.o
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted        0 Jan 1 1970 shovel.o
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted        0 Jan 1 1970 bracelet.o
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted        0 Jan 1 1970 paper.o
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted        0 Jan 1 1970 preserver.o
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted        0 Jan 1 1970 rms.o
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted        0 Jan 1 1970 nil
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 toukmond restricted        0 Jan 1 1970 axe.o
    $

We found are our lost objects! Both the dropped objects (the key and the paper,
see lines 259-262, above) and the inventory objects are all here. And look at
their names. Have you ever wondered why we called the emerald bracelet as
"bracelet", not as "emerald"?  Well, now you know that it is because the real
game itself calls it "bracelet.o" (not "emerald.o"). Maybe you particularly
wondered why the wax statuette of Richard Matthew Stallman was called "rms"
instead of "wax" or "statuette", but now you know why: that object has the name
"rms.o" in the game.

Looking again at the above file listing, we notice one unusual file, "nil". Why
is this file here? Well, if you look way back earlier in our playthrough, you
will see the following:
    % cat walkthroughPA5.txt | sed '248,259\!d'
    >i
    You currently have:
    A lamp
    A shovel
    A brass key
    A bracelet
    A slip of paper
    An axe
    A life preserver
    An RMS statuette
    A floppy disk
    >drop key
    %
    
Comparing this inventory to the objects in the room, we see the floppy disk is
missing. This is a "bug" in the game. Not a real bug; just a "bug". (The reason
is: we cheated to enter the gamma computing center by magically knowing the
3-digit combination. In the real game, you must lose the floppy disk in order
to get the combination. So the game treats the floppy disk name as a don't-care
condition.) So, whereas other objects get named with a ".o", the floppy becomes
"nil".

There is one more point to make: the key is a special object that has the power
to stay in you inventory. Let's restore to the game and not drop the key this
time:
    $ restore AtGammaCenter
    restore: not found.
    $ quit
    quit: not found.
    $

Hey. How do I get out of this? Well, the game considers our typing as UNIX
commands. Is there a command that would be logical to try? Well let's recall
what commands exist:
    $ cd /usr/toukmond
    $ ls
    total 467
    drwxr-xr-x  3 toukmond restricted      512 Jan 1 1970 .

    $ exit

    You step back from the console.

    Computer room
    You are in a computer room.  It seems like most of the equipment has
    been removed.  There is a VAX 11/780 in front of you, however, with
    one of the cabinets wide open.  A sign on the front of the machine
    says: This VAX is named ‘pokey’.  To type on the console, use the
    ‘type’ command.  The exit is to the east.
    The panel lights are flashing in a seemingly organized pattern.

Yes, we know the UNIX command "exit". Well now that we're back to a ">" prompt,
we can restore the saved game, and not drop the key, this time:
    >restore AtGammaCenter
    Done.
    North end of cave passage
    >w
    You must type a 3 digit combination code to enter this room.
    Enter it here: 418
    Gamma computing center
    You are in the Gamma Computing Center.  An IBM 3090/600s is whirring
    away in here.  There is an ethernet cable coming out of one of the units,
    and going through the ceiling.  There is no console here on which you
    could type.
    >cut cable
    As you break the ethernet cable, everything starts to blur.  You collapse
    for a moment, then straighten yourself up.

    Connection closed.

So, yes, the "key.o" file is now in the home directory, while all of our other
inventory objects have been left behind in the gamma computing center. Let's
make sure that it really is in our inventory:
    $ exit

    You step back from the console.

Yes it is in our inventory. This raises a question what would happen if we were
to drop it now:
    >drop key

Yes, it is no longer in our inventory. (Instead it is in the new computer-room
directory -- but we won't worry about that because we aren't going to implement
the exit command or this computer room.)

So this new homework will involve creating the directory structure of pokey,
based in what rooms have been visited, and what objects are in this rooms.
This homework will involve using sed, and the details will come later. But
this file is provided so that you can start thinking about the assignment.
