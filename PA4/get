#Section 3. This section copies all getable objects in the room into ~/_/i/_

# *[aworkv][maxslept]*[mykdrslept]

#  2)That they weigh too much (in which case we need to move them all back to
#  to the current room), or 3)That they don't weigh too much (in which case we
#  to move them from ~/_/i/_ to ~/_/i/i).
#
#  Later in Section X, we'll handle cases 2&3. Right now we just do case 1:

else if ( -e ~/_/i/_/$1 ) then

#Section 7: This section sees if the load is too heavy.
#At this point, every error message, except for the weight message, has been
#printed, and the only way for ~/_/i/_ to be non-empty is that no error message
#has printed. Now we just need to see if the file(s) in ~/_/i/_ are too heavy.
#The command line below has 4 parts:
#  cd ~/_/i: Notice that this is neither ~/_/i/_ or ~/i/i. It is their parent
#            directory, because the total weight is combined between the two
#            child directories.
#
#  __7__: This is A SET OF wildcard patterns that cause different objects to
#         list a different number of times, based on how heavy they are in the
#         game (eg, the "axe" weighs 1 unit, the "preserver" weighs 3, and the
#         "weight" weighs 10). Therefore, your __7__, should produce an output
#         like the following produces:
#         %cd ~/_;mkdir T;mv fi*dir T;cd T;ls __7__;cd ..;mv T/fi*dir .;rmdir T
#         filenamesdir/axe          filenamesdir/gold       filenamesdir/shovel
#         filenamesdir/bed          filenamesdir/ibm        filenamesdir/silver
#         filenamesdir/boulder      filenamesdir/key        filenamesdir/urinal
#         filenamesdir/box          filenamesdir/ladder     filenamesdir/weight
#         filenamesdir/bracelet     filenamesdir/lake       filenamesdir/weight
#         filenamesdir/button       filenamesdir/lamp       filenamesdir/weight
#         filenamesdir/cable        filenamesdir/painting   filenamesdir/weight
#         filenamesdir/chute        filenamesdir/platinum   filenamesdir/weight
#         filenamesdir/description  filenamesdir/preserver  filenamesdir/weight
#         filenamesdir/description  filenamesdir/preserver  filenamesdir/weight
#         filenamesdir/dial         filenamesdir/preserver  filenamesdir/weight

#         filenamesdir/floor        filenamesdir/shovel
#         %
#         Note that, in the above, certain ungettable objects also printed (eg,
#         "floor", "description", and, for some solutions "w"). This is not a
#         problem, because these are don't-care matches, since those files will
#         never exist in ~/_/i/_ or ~/_i/i
#         Note also, your __7__ must search in both subdirectories with each
#         pattern -- you cannot have "i/..." or "_/..." in your answer.
#
#  __8__: This is just a flag to the wc command.
#
#  __9__: This is an extended regular expression. Note:It is one expression. No
#         flags can be used.
