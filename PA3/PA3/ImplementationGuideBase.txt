Note: at the moment this file is unfinished. But I wanted to post some more of
      the assignment for you to read. Look back tomorrow or the next day for
      the full version.

This file describes what needs to go into each of your scripts, in order to get
the basic test working. Therefore this file is divided into 5 sections.

Furthermore, the individual parts of these scripts are intended to be reused
in the full implementation. Therefore each section below is sub-divided into
regions (These parts will then be refered to by their region#, in the guide to
the full implementation.)

| Basic Implementation of "get" |
---------------------------------
Line 1: #!/usr/bin/tcsh

#Section #1:
Line 2: The first argument recieved by this script is supposed to be the name
        of a file in the current room. This line moves that file to the ~/_/i/_
        directory.

#Section #2:
Line 3: cd ~/_/i/_

#Section #3:
Line 4: This line moves everything from ~/_/i/_ into ~/_/i/i. It should not
        produce an error message if nothing is there. It also should print
	"Taken.", if successful.
        Note: To make the basic test run, we could always print "Taken." But
	      we are designing this line in such a way that it can be reused
	      in the full implementation. So the handling of error messages
	      and the "Taken." statement are necessary.

And that is the end of this very simple get script. Note: the full version is
much more complex, because it needs to handle "get all" and "get weight" if it
unpresses the button.
