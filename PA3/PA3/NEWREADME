As stated in the earlier README, the due date is April 16th and cannot be
changed because students need time to study the solution before the midterm.

But I thought of a compromise solution. The assignment can be broken into two
parts. So the homework due this Friday will not include the turn script. And
it will not test behaviors different than the testInput2.sh script that I have
also provided to you in this new tar file. (What makes it new is that all of
the "turn" commands have been removed.)

In addition, I have provided an even smaller test, the new testInput.sh. This
smaller test is the one that is required for a score of 50%. This test does not
involve the grue or going down the hole to the bathroom.
