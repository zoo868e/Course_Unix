Note: I wanted to post some more of the assignment for you to read. Look back
      later tonight for the full version of this file.

This file describes what needs to go into each of your scripts, in order to get
the basic test working. Therefore this file is divided into 5 sections.

Furthermore, the individual parts of these scripts are intended to be reused
in the full implementation. Therefore each section below is sub-divided into
regions (These parts will then be refered to by their region#, in the guide to
the full implementation.)

---------------------------------
| Basic Implementation of "get" |
---------------------------------
Line 1: #!/usr/bin/tcsh

#Section #1:
Line 2: The first argument recieved by this script is supposed to be the name
        of a file in the current room. This line moves that file to the ~/_/i/_
        directory.

#Section #2:
Line 3: cd ~/_/i/_

#Section #3:
Line 4: This line moves everything from ~/_/i/_ into ~/_/i/i. It should not
        produce an error message if nothing is there. It also should print
	"Taken.", if successful.
        Note: To make the basic test run, we could always print "Taken." But
	      we are designing this line in such a way that it can be reused
	      in the full implementation. So the handling of error messages
	      and the "Taken." statement are necessary.

And that is the end of this very simple get script. Note: the full version is
much more complex, because it needs to handle "get all" and "get weight" if it
unpresses the button.


----------------------------------
| Basic Implementation of "drop" |
----------------------------------
Line 1: #!/usr/bin/tcsh

As for the remaining lines, they form a giant "if (...) then ... else if (...)
then ... else if (...) then ... else ..." structure. The bodies of the four
if-cases that are thus created correspond to the following 4 outputs:
 1. "You must supply an object."
 2. "Done."
 3. "I don't know what that is." (In this basic implementation, skip this one.)
 4. "You don't have that."

In the case of "Done.", you need to do more than display the message. You also
need to: 1) Move the object from ~/_/i/i to the room, and 2) Handle with the
situation of dropping the weight on the button. If this situation is detected,
then you need:
 - To display "A passageway opens."
 - To modify the passages out of the room. So you will need to make links (to
   the current directory) for the directions of d, e, ne, se, sw, and w. Also,
   the passageway to the northwest needs to be opened and the ladder going up
   needs to be blocked. You do this by renaming ".nw" to "nw" and "u" to ".u".


----------------------------------
| Basic Implementation of "break" |
----------------------------------
Line 1: #!/usr/bin/tcsh

Ignoring for the moment the final line of the break file (which is "exit 1"),
all of the other remaining lines form a giant "if (...) then ... else if (...)
then ... else if (...) then ... else if (...) then ... else if (...) then ...
else if (...) then ... else if (...) then ... else ..." structure. The bodies
of the eight if-cases thus created correspond to the following 8 outputs:
 1. "You have nothing you can use to break things."
 2. "You must supply an object."
 3. "I don't know what that is."
 4. "I don't see that here."
 5. "Your axe breaks it into a million pieces."
 6. "As you break the ethernet cable, everything starts to blur.  You colla..."
 7. "Your axe shatters into a million pieces."
 8. "You take the object in your hands and swing the axe.  Unfortunately, y..."

Note: These 8 cases need to be in the above order, to match the game. If, for
      example, you type "break dance" without holding the axe, then, logically,
      either message 1 ("You have nothing...") or message 3 ("I don't know...)
      would be correct. The game, however, displays message #1 -- hence, these
      cases have to be in the order indicated above.

Among the above 8 cases, only four are in the basic test (cases 1, 4, 5 and 6).
Among these 4 basic cases, they do what you would expect:
- If you don't have an axe, say:"You have nothing you can use to break things."
- If the first argument is not the name of a file in either your inventory or
  or the room, then say: "I don't see that here."
- If the object is in the room, then remove it and say: "Your axe breaks it
  into a million pieces." (Now, to be technically correct, it is not enough for
  the object to be in the room. It also needs to be gettable. But this is not
  a concern for the basic test, as we never try to break ungettable objects).
- If you break the cable, say "As you break the ethernet cable..." AND also
  exit with a 0. The 0 indicates "success". For break, success means breaking
  the cable (which is the only thing you are meant to break). Returning success
  in only this one condition makes sense with the way break is used. Recall:
    % grep break= PA3.sh
    alias break='source ~/PA3/break2'
    % cat break2
    ~/PA3/break $* && quit
    %

At this point, the break command is finished. Except for one final line:
Final line: exit 1
            By exiting with a failure value, we prevent the break2 script from
	    running the quit alias.


--------------------------------------
| Basic Implementation of "cantmove" |
--------------------------------------
#!/usr/bin/tcsh

#Section #1 is just the following 2 lines:
   #set echo
   set cutfl = "c1-4 --complement"
The purpose of this line is to encourage you to use "set echo" for debugging.
The purpose of cutfl is to provide the flags for the cut command. As stated in
class, it is unfortunate that the --complement flag is so wordy. To compensate,
I defined a variable with the flags we want.


#Section #2:
This section handles the locked door. There are 6 blanks to fill in:
   if ( __1__ ) then
   echo You must type a 3 digit combination code to enter this room.
   echo __2__
   set __3__
   if ( __4__ ) then
      chmod __5__
      cd w
      if ( __6__ ) then
         grep ~/PA3/expl*Walkthrough.txt -elikely|cut -$cutfl|tee de*
	 exit 1
      endif
   else
      echo Sorry, that combination is incorrect.&& exit 0
   endif

__1__ This conditional expression identifies if we're in the right place and
      are trying to go west. The way to recognize this is to look for the "w"
      subdirectory if $1=="w". This works because we know that this cantmove
      script only runs when we have already failed an attempt to go into the
      subdirectory indicated by $1. As we see here:
  % grep " w=" PA3.sh
  alias w='grueK; cd w &>~/X && disp ||~/PA3/cantmove w ||cd w >&~/X||movetry2'
  %
  
__2__: Once we know that the player is trying to get into the locked room, we
       have to ask for the combination.

__3__: Then we have to read the combination from the keyboard.

__4__: Then we have to test if the combination is correct.
       But what is the correct combination? Slide 16 of Lecture 3 describes
       rot-13 encoding. You must use the tr command to transate the encoded
       savedgame file that I've given you, then grep for the word "combination"
       to find the answer.
       (Note: the value is randomly chosen when you start the game, but my
       savedgame file stores the random value that you will use to decide if
       the player can enter the gamma computing center.)

__5__: Unlock the door.
       (Notice that the line after this one is "cd w". But when this cantmove
       script ends, that "cd w" will be lost. So why do it? It is so that we
       can display the description, as described in Section 4, below...

__6__: This conditional tests if the lamp is NOT in the inventory.
       Note: the unusual line below __6__ has similarities to the alias grue.


Section 3:
else if ( __1__ ) then
   echo You cannot go that way. && exit 0
else
   basename `pwd` | tr __2__ | __3__ && echo You cannot go that way. && exit 0
   cd ..
endif

__1__: This conditional expression tests whether there is a subdirectory or
       link named $1.
       
__2__: This determines if the current directory name is the OPPOSITE of $1. For
       example, suppose you go east from the receivingRoom. Then your path will
       be "~/PA3/rooms/receingingRoom/e", and its basename will be "e".
       If you then type "w", then the game needs to let you backtrack. And it
       can know this, because the basename "e" is the opposite of the requested
       movement "w". To be clear: w and e are opposites, n and s are opposites,
       and u and d are opposites. Moreover ne, nw, se, and sw are opposites of
       sw, se, nw, and ne, respectively.
       
__3__: Now that __2__ has converted the basename to its opposite, we need to
       see if tr's output DOESN'T match to $1. (If we checked matching, rather
       than for not-matching, then the exit 0 would have been put inside of a 
       parenthesis, preventing it from working.)
       

#Section #4:
head -n `ls [19]` de* && mv 9 1 >&~/X
grep -hw `ls -d * | paste ~/_/es -` -h ~/_/T*|cut -d\; -f1
exit 3
    This 3-line section is based on Lines 15 & 16 of PA3.sh, and I am therefore
    just giving it to you. This section displays the room that we backtracked
    into. (We still need to move the file 9 to 1, because of the special case
    of going down the hole into the bathroom. then going north to the bedroom.
    This going north is accomplished by a "cd ..",  but the bedroom may not
    have been visited.

| Basic Implementation of "turn" |
----------------------------------
I've decided to move the turn script to a new homework, due after the midterm.
