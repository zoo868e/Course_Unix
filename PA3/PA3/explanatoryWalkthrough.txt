The below walkthrough will help explain how the dunnet game reacts to player
commands. The first part of this file illustrates some basic commands: e, w, l,
x, i, get, and drop. It is important to understand how these commands work,
because you will implement them over the next few homework assignments.

As you read the text below, you will find that, after covering these basic
commands, it goes on to use the restore command to move the game forward to
the part that we will be implementing. Once you reach that point in the reading
below, you may wish to use that savedgame and play the game some for yourself.
After all, you already have the game if you have emacs, and it can be a good
way to get a sense of your homework assignment. That being said, you don't need
to play the game in order to do the assignment, because I show all the expected
output, in this file that you are reading right now. 

To run the dunnet game, type:

    % emacs -batch -l dunnet

    Dead end
    You are at a dead end of a dirt road.  The road goes to the east.
    In the distance you can see that it will eventually fork off.  The
    trees here are very tall royal palms, and they are spaced equidistant
    from each other.
    There is a shovel here.
    >

From the above, we see that we are at the end of a road. There is also a shovel
here. We have also been told that the road goes east. This means that we can
follow the road, by typing "e". Let's try that:

    >e
    E/W Dirt road
    You are on the continuation of a dirt road.  There are more trees on
    both sides of you.  The road continues to the east and west.
    There is a large boulder here.
    >

From the above, we see that we can keep going east, or we can go back west.
Let's go back west:

    > w
    Dead end
    There is a shovel here.
    > l
    Dead end
    You are at a dead end of a dirt road.  The road goes to the east.
    In the distance you can see that it will eventually fork off.  The
    trees here are very tall royal palms, and they are spaced equidistant
    from each other.
    There is a shovel here.
    >

Looking at the above text, we find that the description of the place is much
shorter if you have already visited it. But the above also shows that we can
see the full text by typing "l" (which means "look").

Now let's see how we can interact with the objects in this location. There was
a message above telling us about a shovel. It also said that there were palm
trees and a road. Let's examine these objects, by typing "x":

    >x shovel
    It is a normal shovel with a price tag attached that says $19.99.
    >x tree
    They are palm trees with a bountiful supply of coconuts in them.
    >x road
    I don't know what that is.
    >
    
From the above, we see that not every object mentioned in the description is
actual an object in the game (ie, the game doesn't understand "road".)

The next topic to discuss is our inventory of carried items. We can look at 
it (using "i") and we can pick things up and put them in our inventory (using
"get"), or drop them (using "drop"):

    >i
    You currently have:
    A lamp
    >get tree
    You cannot take that.
    >get shovel
    Taken.
    >get shovel
    I do not see that here.
    >i
    You currently have:
    A lamp
    A shovel
    >drop lamp
    Done.
    >i
    You currently have:
    A shovel
    >

From the above, we see that we start the game carrying a lamp. We also see that
some items can be picked up (such as the shovel), but other items cannot be
taken (such as the tree).
If we picked up the shovel, then it should not be on the ground. And if we
dropped the lamp, then it should be on the ground instead. Let's see:

    >l
    Dead end
    You are at a dead end of a dirt road.  The road goes to the east.
    In the distance you can see that it will eventually fork off.  The
    trees here are very tall royal palms, and they are spaced equidistant
    from each other.
    There is a lamp nearby.
    >

Correct. The shovel is no longer there, but the lamp is. Let's move around
some and see how things display:

    >e
    E/W Dirt road
    There is a large boulder here.
    >w
    Dead end
    There is a lamp nearby.
    >

From the above, we see that the game remembers locations that you have already
visited. Instead of giving a long description when you enter these locations,
it just gives the name of the room. But we also see that it still will display
the objects that are present (ie, the boulder, shovel, or lamp). But remember
that there was also a tree object, and that one doesn't display. So objects
that give messages every time you enter the room are a subset of the total
objects in the game. And the objects that can be picked up are also a subset
of all objects (eg, the shovel and lamp can be picked up, but the tree and the
boulder cannot be picked up).

Note that, even though only the short description is given when re-entering a
place, the long description can still be seen by typing 'l':

    >e
    E/W Dirt road
    There is a large boulder here.
    >l
    E/W Dirt road
    You are on the continuation of a dirt road.  There are more trees on
    both sides of you.  The road continues to the east and west.
    There is a large boulder here.
    >

Now that we know the game mechanics, let's start thinking about our programming
assignment. This year we will be implementing the second level of the game. So
we will not need to worry about the tree or boulder objects.

In the same directory as this README file, you'll see a file named "savedgame".
In the game, we can use the restore command to load a saved gamed. Let's do so:
    
    >restore ~/PA1/savedgame
    Done.
    Receiving room
    You are in a round, stone room with a door to the east.  There
    is a sign on the wall that reads: ‘receiving room’.
    There is a lamp nearby.
    There is a shovel here.
    There is a shiny brass key here.
    There is an emerald bracelet here.
    There is a slip of paper here.
    There is an axe here.
    >

From the above, we notice that there are many objects here. In particular,
there is an axe. This axe would not be here if you played the first level of
the game then arrived in this room. Instead I hacked the save file, to move
the axe to this place. I did this because we will not implement the room that
has the axe, but we will need the axe for homework #3.

At this point, you can, if you want, play the game yourself for a while and try
to solve some of the puzzles. You might find it easier to learn by just playing
that game, than by reading what is written below. At some point, however, read
the text below. It solves the puzzles that you may not be able to, such as the
maze, and it goes through the behaviors that you will (in later homeworks) be
putting into your game. So, when you are ready to read on, let's keep playing:

    >e
    Northbound Hallway
    You are at the south end of a hallway that leads to the north.  There
    are rooms to the east and west.
    >n
    It is pitch dark.  You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
    >s
    You trip over a grue and fall into a pit and break every bone in your
    body.
    You are dead.
    You have scored 0 out of a possible 90 points.
    %

OK, so not taking the lamp was a bad idea. Let's try again:

    >restore ~/PA1/savedgame
    Done.
    Receiving room
    You are in a round, stone room with a door to the east.  There
    is a sign on the wall that reads: ‘receiving room’.
    There is a lamp nearby.
    There is a shovel here.
    There is a shiny brass key here.
    There is an emerald bracelet here.
    There is a slip of paper here.
    There is an axe here.
    >get all
    A lamp: Taken.
    A shovel: Taken.
    A brass key: Taken.
    A bracelet: Taken.
    A slip of paper: Taken.
    An axe: Taken.
    >e
    Northbound Hallway
    You are at the south end of a hallway that leads to the north.  There
    are rooms to the east and west.
    >n
    End of N/S Hallway
    You are at the end of a north/south hallway.  You can go back to the south,
    or off to a room to the east.
    >e
    Weight room
    You are in an old weight room.  All of the equipment is either destroyed or
    completely broken.  There is a door out to the west, and there is a ladder
    leading down a hole in the floor.
    There is a 10 pound weight here.
    There is a life preserver here.
    >get all
    A weight: Your load would be too heavy.
    A life preserver: Taken.
    >drop all
    I don't know what that is.
    >

From the above, we see that you can type 'get all', but you cannot type 'drop
all'. We also see that you have a weight limit. Let's keep going:

    >w
    End of N/S Hallway
    >e
    Weight room
    There is a 10 pound weight here.
    >w
    End of N/S Hallway
    >s
    Northbound Hallway
    >w
    Receiving room
    >e
    Northbound Hallway
    >e
    Sauna
    You are in a sauna.  There is nothing in the room except for a dial
    on the wall.  A door leads out to west.
    It is normal room temperature in here.
    >x sauna
    I don't know what that is.
    >x dial
    The dial points to a temperature scale which has long since faded away.
    >
    
Let's see how this dial works:
    >turn dial
    You must indicate clockwise or counterclockwise.
    >turn dial counterclockwise
    The dial will not turn further in that direction.
    >turn dial clockwise
    It is now luke warm in here.  You are perspiring.
    >turn dial counterclockwise
    The temperature has returned to normal room temperature.
    >

As you keep turning the dial clockwise, the message changes:
    >w
    Northbound Hallway
    >e
    Sauna
    It is normal room temperature in here.
    >turn dial clockwise
    It is now luke warm in here.  You are perspiring.
    >w
    Northbound Hallway
    >e
    Sauna
    It is luke warm in here.
    >turn dial clockwise
    It is pretty hot in here.  It is still very comfortable.
    >w
    Northbound Hallway
    >e
    Sauna
    It is comfortably hot in here.
    >turn dial clockwise
    It is now very hot.  There is something very refreshing about this.
    >w
    Northbound Hallway
    >e
    Sauna
    It is refreshingly hot in here.
    >turn dial counterclockwise
    It is pretty hot in here.  It is still very comfortable.
    >w
    Northbound Hallway
    >e
    Sauna
    It is comfortably hot in here.
    >turn dial clockwise
    It is now very hot.  There is something very refreshing about this.
    >turn dial clockwise
    As the dial clicks into place, you immediately burst into flames.

    You are dead.
    You have scored 0 out of a possible 90 points.
    %

OK, so that was mistake. Let's try again. This time lets only get the lamp, so
that we won't have a weight limit problem:
    >restore ~/PA1/savedgame
    Done.
    Receiving room
    You are in a round, stone room with a door to the east.  There
    is a sign on the wall that reads: ‘receiving room’.
    There is a lamp nearby.
    There is a shovel here.
    There is a shiny brass key here.
    There is an emerald bracelet here.
    There is a slip of paper here.
    There is an axe here.
    >get lamp
    Taken.
    >e
    Northbound Hallway
    You are at the south end of a hallway that leads to the north.  There
    are rooms to the east and west.
    >n
    End of N/S Hallway
    You are at the end of a north/south hallway.  You can go back to the south,
    or off to a room to the east.
    >e
    Weight room
    You are in an old weight room.  All of the equipment is either destroyed or
    completely broken.  There is a door out to the west, and there is a ladder
    leading down a hole in the floor.
    There is a 10 pound weight here.
    There is a life preserver here.
    >get weight
    Taken.
    >d
    Maze button room
    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
    There is a button on the ground here.
    >

At this point, we've reached the first puzzle. The maze doesn't tell us the
directions that we can move. We just have to use trial and error:
    >n
    You can't go that way.
    >s
    You can't go that way.
    >e
    Maze button room
    >w
    Maze button room
    >ne
    Maze button room
    >nw
    You can't go that way.
    >se
    Maze button room
    >sw
    Maze button room
    >d
    Maze button room
    >u
    Weight room
    There is a life preserver here.
    >

Well, we tried every direction and none worked. Some were not allowed (n,s,nw)
and others only took us back to where we started (the maze button room). The
only move that had any effect was to climb back up the ladder. Obviously, the
solution must involve the button:

    >d
    Maze button room
    >press button
    As you press the button, you notice a passageway open up, but
    as you release it, the passageway closes.
    >drop weight
    Done.
    A passageway opens.
    >u
    You can't go that way.
    >get weight
    Taken.
    >u
    Weight room
    There is a life preserver here.
    >

From the above, we see that the weight can hold the button down. And when the
button is pressed, you can no longer go up. You can go in other directions,
however.

The connections in the maze are as follows:

               Maze1 --------------> Maze2 <--------+<-----+


To navigate the maze, think of the word "used (u, se, d)", plus other nw & se:
    >nw
    Maze
    You are in a maze of little twisty passages, all alike.
    >u
    Maze
    You are in a maze of thirsty little passages, all alike.
    There is a wax statuette of Richard Stallman here.
    There is a floppy disk here.
    >get all

    >

In that last step, we could have gone to the nw to the reception area, rather
that nw to the weight room (as the map from above shows). But we needed to go
back and get our things, the life preserver in particular:

    >get all

    Reception area
    You are in a reception area for a health and fitness center.  The place
    appears to have been recently ransacked, and nothing is left.  There is
    a door out to the south, and a crawlspace to the southeast.
    >s

    You dive in the water, and at first notice it is quite cold.  You then
    start to get used to it as you realize that you never really learned how

    You are dead.
    You have scored 0 out of a possible 90 points.
    %

Well that was a mistake. Let us instead not drop the life preserver:

    >s
    Lakefront North
    You are at the north side of a lake.  On the other side you can see
    a road which leads to a cave.  The water appears very deep.
    >s

    You are at the south side of a lake.  A road goes to the south.
    >s
    Cave Entrance
    The entrance to a cave is to the south.  To the north, a road leads
    towards a deep lake.  On the ground nearby there is a chute, with a sign
    that says ‘put treasures here for points’.
    >

This chute is a place to score points:

    >x chute
    I see nothing special about that.
    >score
    You have scored 0 out of a possible 90 points.
    >put bracelet in chute

    You have scored 10 out of a possible 90 points.
    >score

The bracelet was worth 10 points. But none of our other items are treasures:
    >i
    You currently have:

    An RMS statuette
    A floppy disk
    A life preserver

    >put key in chute
    You hear it slide down the chute and off into the distance.
    >score
    You have scored 10 out of a possible 90 points.
    >l
    Cave Entrance
    The entrance to a cave is to the south.  To the north, a road leads
    towards a deep lake.  On the ground nearby there is a chute, with a sign
    that says ‘put treasures here for points’.
    >i
    You currently have:
    A lamp
    An RMS statuette
    An axe
    >

We see that none of these items gained me any points. We also see that they
gone. Now let us consider the statuette in more detail:
    >x rms
    The statuette is of the likeness of Richard Stallman, the author of the
    famous EMACS editor.  You notice that he is not wearing any shoes.
    >drop rms
    Done.
    >n
    Lakefront South
    >x rms
    I don't see that here.
    >s
    Cave Entrance
    There is a wax statuette of Richard Stallman here.
    >x rms
    The statuette is of the likeness of Richard Stallman, the author of the
    famous EMACS editor.  You notice that he is not wearing any shoes.
    >

From the above, we see that you don't need to be holding an object to examine
it, but you do have to be in the same place. We also learn that the statuette
is made of wax. (The x command does not tell us this, but we see the message
"There is a wax statuette of Richard Stallman here.") Why wax? Well, wax melts.
Was there a way to melt it? Well, too late now, let's put it down the chute:

    >put rms in chute
    You don't have that.
    >get rms
    Taken.
    >put rms in chute
    You hear it slide down the chute and off into the distance.
    >score
    You have scored 10 out of a possible 90 points.
    >

From the above, we see that objects cannot be put in the chute unless you have
them in your inventory (unlike x, which allowed them to be on the ground).
We also see that the statuette gives you no points, in its current form (maybe
if we had melted it...).

Anyway, let's keep going:
    >s
    As you enter the room you hear a rumbling noise.  You look back to see
    huge rocks sliding down from the ceiling, and blocking your way out.
    
    Misty Room
    You are in a misty, humid room carved into a mountain.
    To the north is the remains of a rockslide.  To the east, a small
    passage leads away into the darkness.
    There is a gold bar here.
    >n
    You can't go that way.
    >

At this point, there is no going back. It is the third level of the game. We
will only implement a small part of this level:
    >get gold
    Taken.
    >e
    Cave E/W passage
    You are in an east/west passageway.  The walls here are made of
    multicolored rock and are quite beautiful.
    >e
    N/S/W Junction
    You are at the junction of two passages. One goes north/south, and
    the other goes west.
    >s
    South end of cave passage
    You are at the south end of a north/south passageway.  There is a hole
    in the floor here, into which you could probably fit.
    >d
    Bathroom
    You are in a bathroom built for workers in the cave.  There is a
    urinal hanging on the wall, and some exposed pipes on the opposite
    wall where a sink used to be.  To the north is a bedroom.
    >u
    You can't go that way.
    >

Here we see that you cannot climb back up the hole. Well, lets look around the
bathroom:
    >x pipes
    I see nothing special about that.
    >x pipe
    I see nothing special about that.
    >x urinal
    The urinal is very clean compared with everything else in the cave.  There
    isn't even any rust.  Upon close examination you realize that the drain at
    the bottom is missing, and there is just a large hole leading down the
    pipes into nowhere.  The hole is too small for a person to fit in.  The
    flush handle is so clean that you can see your reflection in it.
    >

Why is that handle so shiny? It is broken, so why is it still being used?
    >put gold in urinal
    You hear it plop down in some water below.
    >flush
    Whoooosh!!
    You have scored 20 out of a possible 90 points.

OK. It is a way to save treasure. Let's move on:
    >l
    Bathroom
    You are in a bathroom built for workers in the cave.  There is a
    urinal hanging on the wall, and some exposed pipes on the opposite
    wall where a sink used to be.  To the north is a bedroom.
    >n
    Bedroom
    You are in what appears to be a worker's bedroom.  There is a queen-
    sized bed in the middle of the room, and a painting hanging on the
    wall.  A door leads to another room to the south, and stairways
    lead up and down.
    >x bed
    It is a queen sized bed, with a very firm mattress.
    >x painting
    It is a velvet painting of Elvis Presley.  It seems to be nailed to the
    wall, and you cannot move it.
    >
    
Now these stairs go up and down. But we are not going to implement the rooms
that are below. So let's go up.
    >u
    North end of cave passage
    You are at the north end of a north/south passageway.  There are stairs
    leading down from here.  There is also a door leading west.
    >s
    N/S/W Junction
    >s
    South end of cave passage
    >d
    Bathroom
    >n
    Bedroom
    >u
    North end of cave passage
    You are at the north end of a north/south passageway.  There are stairs
    leading down from here.  There is also a door leading west.
    >

So there is a loop (s,s,d,n,u) here. There is only one more room in our version
of the game, the room behind that western door:

    >w
    You must type a 3 digit combination code to enter this room.
    Enter it here:123
    Sorry, that combination is incorrect.
    >
    
What is the combination? We'll have to find that out later (it was on the
floppy disk, but that is not how we will find it out). For now, lets assume it
is '123':
    >w
    You must type a 3 digit combination code to enter this room.
    Enter it here:123
    Gamma computing center
    You are in the Gamma Computing Center.  An IBM 3090/600s is whirring
    away in here.  There is an ethernet cable coming out of one of the units,
    and going through the ceiling.  There is no console here on which you
    could type.
    >x ibm
    I see nothing special about that.
    >x cable
    I see nothing special about that.
    >cut cable
    As you break the ethernet cable, everything starts to blur. You collapse
    for a moment, then straighten yourself up.

And that is as far as we will play the game, for now.
There are a few special situations that we can go back and see, however.
Let's go back to the maze button room:
    >d
    Maze button room
    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
    There is a button on the ground here.
    >drop weight
    Done.
    A passageway opens.
    >nw
    Maze
    You are in a maze of little twisty passages, all alike.
    >u
    Maze
    You are in a maze of thirsty little passages, all alike.
    There is a wax statuette of Richard Stallman here.
    There is a floppy disk here.
    >get all
    An RMS statuette: Taken.
    A floppy disk: Taken.
    >se
    Maze
    You are in a maze of twenty little passages, all alike.
    >d
    Maze
    You are in a daze of twisty little passages, all alike.
    >nw
    Maze
    You are in a maze of twisty little cabbages, all alike.
    >ne
    Weight room
    There is a life preserver here.
    >w
    End of N/S Hallway
    >s
    Northbound Hallway
    >drop floppy
    Done.
    >e
    Sauna
    It is normal room temperature in here.
    >i
    You currently have:
    A lamp
    An RMS statuette
    >turn dial clockwise
    It is now luke warm in here.  You are perspiring.
    >turn dial clockwise
    It is pretty hot in here.  It is still very comfortable.
    >turn dial clockwise
    It is now very hot.  There is something very refreshing about this.
    You notice the wax on your statuette beginning to melt, until it completely
    melts off.  You are left with a beautiful diamond!
    >w
    Northbound Hallway
    There is a floppy disk here.
    >get all
    A floppy disk: Taken.
    >i
    You currently have:
    A lamp
    A diamond
    A floppy disk
    >x diamond
    I see nothing special about that.
    >e
    Sauna
    It is refreshingly hot in here.
    You notice your floppy disk beginning to melt.  As you grab for it, the
    disk bursts into flames, and disintegrates.
    >i
    You currently have:
    A lamp
    A diamond
    >w
    Northbound Hallway
    >n

    Weight room
    There is a life preserver here.
    >d
    Maze button room
    There is a 10 pound weight here.

    Reception area
    You are in a reception area for a health and fitness center.  The place
    appears to have been recently ransacked, and nothing is left.  There is
    a door out to the south, and a crawlspace to the southeast.
    >s
    As you exit the building, you notice some flames coming out of one of the
    windows.  Suddenly, the building explodes in a huge ball of fire.  The
    flames engulf you, and you burn to death.

    You are dead.
    You have scored 0 out of a possible 90 points.
    %

From the above we see that the fully-heated sauna room has three effects:
- It melts the statuette to create the diamond.
- It melts the floppy disk.
- It kills you if you try to leave the health and fitness center.

Although you will be implementing all of the above output, you will not be
doing so all at once. In this first programming assignment, you will only
be creating the rooms and putting objects in those rooms.

You finished this file. So now go read the "~/PA1/PA1description.txt" file.
